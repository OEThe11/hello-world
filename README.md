Its the tradi.... You already know what it is.


Alright, im Osayuki. Im a self thought programer embarging on a new path for myself. With the age old story of having to do 
something different because the degree I acuired from my university wasnt worth a damm after I graduated. so i turned to 
coding, since this was an intrest of mines during my time in college.
